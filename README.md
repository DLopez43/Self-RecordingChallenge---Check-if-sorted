# Self-RecordingChallenge---Check-if-sorted
## Summary

This challenge is designed to help you practice **technical communication** by recording yourself as you solve and explain a coding problem.

## Learning Objectives

Practice **thinking out loud** while solving a problem.
Clearly explain your reasoning, code choices, and any trade-offs.
Write and test your own code, including additional test cases.
Reflect on the **time complexity** of your solution.
## Challenge

Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns `true` if the array is sorted in ascending order, or `false` otherwise.

## Instructions

Record yourself explaining your thought process while working on the challenge.
You may use Zoom, QuickTime (Mac), Snipping Tool/Xbox Game Bar (Windows), or another screen recording tool.
Solve the problem **iteratively first**.
If time allows, attempt an alternate solution (e.g., recursive or functional programming style).
Add and walk through at least **two additional test cases** in your recording.
End your recording by briefly discussing the **time complexity** of your solution.
## Deliverable

A video recording (maximum 25 minutes).
Your completed `index.js` file, including test cases.
